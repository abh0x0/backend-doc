# GraphQL API Architecture Analysis

## Overview
The system implements two separate GraphQL endpoints:
- `appgraphql`: Primary API used by Android and iOS mobile clients
- `admingraphql`: Administrative interface

## API Structure

### App GraphQL Implementation
Located in `/service/monolith/appgraphql/`

Key Components:
- Custom directives for authentication and authorization
- Data loaders for efficient batch loading
- Resolver implementations with business logic
- Generated code from schema definitions

### Schema Organization
- Common schema definitions in `/service/monolith/commongraphql/`
- Modular schema files split by domain:
  - auth.graphql
  - balance.graphql
  - marketorder.graphql
  - p2p.graphql
  - user.graphql
  etc.

## Mobile Integration Points

### Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token mechanism
- Device registration and management
- 2FA implementation

### Real-time Updates
- Notification system integration
- Balance updates
- Order status changes
- Price updates

### Data Loading Optimizations
- Implemented DataLoaders for:
  - Balance totals
  - Amount calculations
  - Balance event details
- Batch loading to prevent N+1 query problems

## Current Limitations & Improvement Areas

1. Schema Organization
- Consider splitting schema into more granular domains
- Implement better schema versioning
- Add more comprehensive schema documentation

2. Performance Optimization
- Implement persisted queries
- Add query complexity analysis
- Improve caching strategy

3. Mobile-specific Enhancements
- Optimize payload size for mobile data usage
- Implement better offline support
- Add field-level error handling

4. Security
- Add rate limiting per client
- Implement better query depth limiting
- Add more granular permission checks

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Short Term
- Add comprehensive API documentation
- Implement query complexity limits
- Add performance monitoring

2. Medium Term
- Split monolithic GraphQL into domain-specific services
- Implement proper schema versioning
- Add GraphQL subscription support

3. Long Term
- Move to federated GraphQL architecture
- Implement proper service mesh
- Add end-to-end type safety

## Mobile Client Considerations

### Android
- Implement proper caching
- Add offline support
- Optimize network usage

### iOS
- Implement proper error handling
- Add retry mechanisms
- Optimize memory usage

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
- Resolver tests
- Directive tests
- DataLoader tests

2. Integration Tests
- End-to-end API tests
- Performance tests
- Load tests

3. Mobile Tests
- Client library tests
- Integration tests
- UI tests

## Monitoring & Observability

1. Metrics to Track
- Query response times
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates
- Query complexity scores

2. Logging
- Query logging
- Error logging
- Performance logging

3. Alerting
- Error rate thresholds
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
